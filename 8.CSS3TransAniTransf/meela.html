            This is Meela Zendejas. Her start to life has been a continuous uphill battle.
            Meela was born at 27 due to complications with Mom. However, due to additional
            conplications, Meela suffered from IUGR (Intrauterine growth restriction) and 
            only measured at 20 weeks and weighing only 15 Oz.

            After multiple failed attempts to remove her breathing tube, doctors decided
            that a tracheostomy was needed. She still has her trach to this day.

            Although she has been through so much in her early days, her personality
            shined. As the days went on in the NICU, we started to see her sassy and 
            loving personality bloom to what it is today.
